## Project overview

This Quarto project consolidates the exploratory analysis and the ML-based match outcome prediction into a single, reproducible report.

**Core goals**

1. Distribution of matches by surface.
2. Match duration by surface.
3. Serving metrics across surfaces.
4. Match outcome prediction (pre-match and diagnostic settings).

## Data

The analysis is based on ATP & WTA match data from 2015-2023. Raw CSV files are loaded from `D:/DATA SCIENCE NEW/tennis_matches`.

## Reports

- **Full Report**: The complete notebook with EDA, modeling, and diagnostics.

## Final narrative summary

This report provides a compact EDA of surface distribution, match duration, and serving profiles across surfaces, then extends to match outcome prediction. The EDA confirms clear surface effects, while modeling shows moderate pre-match predictability and strong diagnostic performance when in-match serve stats are included. Error analysis highlights the most challenging cases (tight rank gaps and very long matches), providing guidance for future feature engineering and model refinement.
